queue of packets

Packet queuing and loss: if arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for some period of time:
packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link 
packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up
Introduction: 1-32
----------------------------------------

슬라이드 33:
Alternative to packet switching: circuit switching
end-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source and destination
in diagram, each link has four circuits. 
call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st circuit in right link.
dedicated resources: no sharing
circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)
* Check out the online interactive exercises for more examples: http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive
commonly used in traditional telephone networks
Introduction: 1-33
----------------------------------------

슬라이드 34:
Circuit switching: FDM and TDM
Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
optical, electromagnetic frequencies divided into (narrow) frequency bands
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
time divided into slots
each call allocated its own band, can transmit at max rate of that narrow band
each call allocated periodic slot(s), can transmit at maximum rate of (wider) frequency band (only)  during its time slot(s)
Introduction: 1-34

슬라이드 35:
Packet switching versus circuit switching
example:
1 Gb/s link
each user: 
100 Mb/s when “active”
active 10% of time
Q: how many users can use this network under circuit-switching and packet switching?
* Check out the online interactive exercises for more examples: http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive
circuit-switching: 10 users
Introduction: 1-35
----------------------------------------

슬라이드 36:
Packet switching versus circuit switching
great for “bursty” data – sometimes has data to send, but at other times not
resource sharing
simpler, no call setup
excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow
protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
Q: How to provide circuit-like behavior with packet-switching?
“It’s complicated.” We’ll study various techniques that try to make packet switching as “circuit-like” as possible.
Is packet switching a “slam dunk winner”?
Q:  human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching) versus on-demand allocation (packet switching)?
Introduction: 1-36
----------------------------------------

슬라이드 37:
Internet structure: a “network of networks”
hosts connect to Internet via access Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
access ISPs in turn must be interconnected
so that any two hosts (anywhere!) can send packets to each other
resulting network of networks is very complex
evolution driven by economics, national policies
Let’s take a stepwise approach to describe current Internet structure

car ~ bit; caravan ~ packet; toll service ~ link transmission
toll booth takes 12 sec to service car (bit transmission time)

Q: How long until caravan is lined up before 2nd toll booth?
time to “push” entire caravan through toll booth onto highway = 12*10 = 120 sec
time for last car to propagate from 1st to 2nd toll both: 100km/(100km/hr) = 1 hr

Bad guys: denial of service
Denial of Service (DoS): attackers make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with bogus traffic
1. select target
2. break into hosts around the network (see botnet)
3. send packets to target from compromised hosts
Introduction: 1-64
----------------------------------------

슬라이드 65:
Lines of defense:
authentication: proving you are who you say you are
cellular networks provides hardware identity via SIM card; no such hardware assist in traditional Internet
confidentiality: via encryption
integrity checks: digital signatures prevent/detect tampering
access restrictions:  password-protected VPNs
firewalls: specialized “middleboxes” in access and core networks:
off-by-default: filter incoming packets to restrict senders, receivers, applications 
detecting/reacting to DOS attacks

Why layering?
Approach to designing/discussing complex systems:
explicit structure allows identification, relationship of system’s pieces
layered reference model for discussion
modularization eases maintenance, updating of system
change in layer's service implementation: transparent to rest of system
e.g., change in gate procedure doesn’t affect rest of system

Services, Layering and Encapsulation
source
transport-layer protocol encapsulates application-layer message, M, with transport layer-layer header Ht to create a transport-layer segment
Ht  used by transport layer protocol to implement its service
destination
Application exchanges messages to implement some application service using services of transport layer

슬라이드 73:
Services, Layering and Encapsulation
source
Transport-layer protocol transfers M (e.g., reliably) from one process to another, using services of network layer
network-layer protocol encapsulates transport-layer segment  [Ht | M] with network layer-layer header Hn  to create a network-layer datagram 
Hn  used by network layer protocol to implement its service
destination

슬라이드 74:
Services, Layering and Encapsulation
source
link-layer protocol encapsulates network datagram [Hn| [Ht |M], with link-layer header Hl  to create a link-layer frame
destination
Link-layer protocol transfers datagram [Hn| [Ht |M] from host to neighboring host, using network-layer services
Network-layer protocol transfers transport-layer segment [Ht | M] from one host to another, using link layer services

What is the Internet?
What is a protocol?
Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
Network core: packet/circuit switching, internet structure
Performance: loss, delay, throughput
Security
Protocol layers, service models
History
