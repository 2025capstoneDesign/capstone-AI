Welcome. In this first video, I will provide an overview of the introductory material. We will discuss what the internet is and what a protocol is. The goal of this introductory material is twofold.
    Let's start by providing an overview of computer networking to give you a big picture view. We will also introduce key vocabulary that will be covered in more detail later. Everything discussed here will be revisited in more depth. We will begin by addressing two questions in this introduction, which aligns with chapter one of our textbook.
    The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using a common set of rules called protocols. Protocols are essentially a set of guidelines that dictate how data should be transmitted and received over a network. 

When we explore the internet, we can start by examining the network edge, which includes the devices connected to the internet and the physical infrastructure that enables connectivity. We can then delve deeper into the network core, where we'll discuss two fundamental technologies: circuit switching and packet switching. Circuit switching is the traditional method used by telephone networks, while packet switching forms the foundation of the internet.

Within a packet-switched network, data is broken down into smaller units called packets, which are then routed through the network by devices like routers and switches. We'll also explore the overall structure of networks and how these components work together to facilitate communication across the internet.
    We will discuss the concept of the internet being a network of networks. We will explore network performance, including issues like packet loss and delays during transmission. Throughput, which measures the rate of data transfer from source to destination, will also be covered. Protocol layers will be explained as a method to break down the complexity of the internet into more manageable parts. Additionally, we will touch on the service model offered by a network.
    We will briefly discuss network security and the history of computer networks, which predates the internet. Let's start by asking, what is the internet? The answer varies depending on who you ask. To illustrate, here is a quote from a BBC comedy: "What is it? This gen. It's the internet. Well, that's right. This is the internet. The whole internet. Yep. I asked for a loan of it so that you could use it in your speech. It's so small."
    One surprising aspect is its wireless nature. Nowadays, many things are wireless. Children can provide interesting perspectives on it, likening it to a helpful robot at home. Some individuals may confuse the internet as a thinking entity, but it is actually an engineered artifact like a roadway or telephone network. Let's approach it from an engineering standpoint.
    We can take two viewpoints here. Our first approach is a nuts and bolts perspective. Let's discuss the components of the internet. Starting at the edge of the network, we have the devices used by internet users like us to connect. These devices, also known as hosts or end systems, come in various types and billions are connected to the internet.
    Computers, personal computers, data centers, and smartphones are all connected to the internet. Additionally, there are internet-connected gaming and media streaming devices in homes, digital personal assistants, security cameras, energy monitors, appliances such as refrigerators, washers, dryers, picture frames, and even mattresses that can be connected to the internet. Personal health and fitness devices, human augmentation devices like AR and VR glasses, as well as vehicles like cars (such as Tesla), trucks, scooters, and bikes are also connected to the internet.
    One interesting device is a toaster connected to the internet that downloads the weather forecast and burns it into your toast. This project originated in the early 2000s at a UK university. Connecting digital devices to the internet can add value, and providing internet connectivity to analog devices like bikes and scooters can create new possibilities for their use.
    Moving deeper into the network, we find the devices that make the network actually a network, which are packet switches that forward packets, chunks of data between each other and between hosts and devices. There are two types of packet switches: routers and switches. These switches and routers are interconnected by communication links, forming networks owned and operated by various entities. For instance, on the UMass campus, we operate our own campus network.
    The UMass network differs from the internet backbone network connecting networks on other campuses. The internet is known as a network of networks due to the presence of multiple networks. Information exchange among routers, switches, hosts, and end devices in a network is regulated by protocols. Protocols play a crucial role in governing network operations. This course focuses on networking principles, practices, and the significance of protocols.
    Protocols describe a standard way of doing things, and the body that defines these standards for the internet is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Their standards are known as RFCs (Requests for Comments). Another perspective is to view the internet as a platform for implementing various applications.
    As a service platform, the internet facilitates the exchange of information between applications. This is essentially the core function of the internet - enabling the transfer of data between different points in a network. The applications on the internet can be highly advanced and intricate. For instance, consider the process involved in starting a streaming movie on your TV by using voice commands. The complexity of the operations happening within the applications to accomplish this task is quite remarkable.
    The application level complexity is built upon a basic service infrastructure that simply delivers packets from one location to another. The computing primarily occurs in the applications. This is part of the internet, and we will focus more on the information delivery aspects rather than the structure of distributed applications. We will touch on the application layer later. To conclude, let's revisit the concept of protocols. The internet revolves around protocols. So, what exactly is an internet protocol?
    One way to understand internet protocols is by considering human protocols. Humans follow protocols regularly. For instance, let's look at the "what time is it" protocol. The protocol involves one person asking another for the time, and the second person responding by checking the time and providing it. This exchange demonstrates a request and a reply. This simple example illustrates how protocols work.
    Here's a useful technique called the question-asking protocol. When the professor asks if there are any questions, students can either consult their notes, look up for a moment, or raise their hand to ask a question. This creates a multi-step question and answer process during the class.
    Pause for a moment and consider other human protocols. Think of some good human protocols. For the protocols you thought of and the ones we discussed earlier like the question-answer protocol and the what time is it protocol, what common elements do you notice? Specific messages are sent and actions are taken when the other party receives those messages in these protocols.
    Computer network protocols are analogous to human protocols, where network components exchange messages based on a protocol. For example, in the "what time is it" human protocol, there are two phases: the greeting phase and the request phase. This is similar to protocols used on the web, which involve a connection request phase followed by a request-response phase.
    With this background, we can define a network protocol as specifying the format and order of messages exchanged between network entities, along with the actions taken during message transmission and receipt. We covered two key technical concepts: understanding the internet from the edge to the core, and defining what a protocol is.
    In the next section, we will focus on a nuts and bolts approach to understanding the internet. We will begin at the edge with devices, as discussed earlier, and then move inward.
